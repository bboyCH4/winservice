/* Each vbd needs three pages (two for the TARGET_INFO and one for the
   ring), plus we need at least one bounce buffer, and we need one
   more for other allocations.  We need to support at least 4 disks,
   so we need 4*4=16 pages.  Add an extra couple of pages just to be
   safe, since running out of memory in the austere heap usually leads
   to a crash. */
